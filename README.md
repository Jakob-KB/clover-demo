# clover-demo

Simple auth-required LLM testing environment.

To run the demo web app locally simple enter `streamlit run main.py` into the commandline from the project root.

To do:
- add extra accounts
- upload documents to chromaDB
- Big annoying job... create multiple repos (at least the demo repo is done)


all repos
- clover-llm (the API and LLM system)
- clover-demo (the demo web app)
- clover-devops (all on server files)
- clover-infra (handle random operations like vectorDB ingestion, dummy account creation, etc)
